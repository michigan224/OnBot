# OnBot
Personal discord bot for my lazy friends who can't find the effort to see who is on by themselves.

On any use of the phrase ```who's on``` or similar phrases, the bot will check and display what all online users are doing and/or listening to.

# Commands
The bot is also able to add requests for my Plex server using:

Any use of both words ```who``` and ```on``` in the same message to see who is on

```request``` to make a request

```delete request``` to delete a request

```get requests``` to list all current requests.

# To run
Run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` then run ```python main.py```
